# SAVeS: Scoping Autnonomous Vehicle Simulation Platform
This is a evaluation platform designed to help researchers to easily test and compare various datasets generated from simulation and their real-world counterparts on the selected algorithms.
Currently, our platform supports the following geometric SLAM based algorithms and learning-based models via scripts and step-to-step guides:

|Geometric-based Algorithms|Learning-based Models|
|--------------------------|---------------------|
|A-LOAM                    |GeoNet               |
|LeGO-LOAM                 |AdaBins              |
|ORBSLAM3                  |DPT                  |

We provide scripts to process following datasets, with more supports coming along the way:

|Real-world Datasets       |Synthetic Datasets   |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
|nuScenes                  |GTA V - PreSIL       |
|KITTI                     |CARLA                |

We are also providing guides on evaluating the results.
This paltform is under development.
