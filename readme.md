# SAVeS: Scoping Autnonomous Vehicle Simulation Platform
This is a evaluation platform designed to help researchers to easily test and compare various datasets generated from simulation and their real-world counterparts on the selected algorithms.
Currently, our platform supports the following geometric SLAM based algorithms and learning-based models via scripts and step-to-step guides:

|Geometric-based Algorithms|Learning-based Models|

We provide scripts to process following datasets, with more supports coming along the way:

We are also providing guides on evaluating the results.
This paltform is under development.
